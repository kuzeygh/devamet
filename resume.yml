  summary: 'I consider myself as a world citizen, Computer Scientist & Engineer, and php and cakephp Expert. I really like jQuery too. I code PHP and web applications since dial-up years (2001). I like to contribute and create open source software projects. I am always willing to learn new things even though I have 14 years of experience. I also design as a hobby. Other than coding and design, I like music, play guitar and drums, singing in choirs since I was 7. I believe in science and I am a woman who believes in equal opportunity for everyone.
